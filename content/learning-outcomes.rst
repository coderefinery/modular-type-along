Learning topics
===============

-  Know about **pure functions** (functions without side effects, functions which
   given same input always return same output).
-  Learn why and how to **limit side effects** of functions.
-  Discuss why and how to limit side effects of data. Also discuss when
   mutable data may be preferable.
-  The Zen of Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
-  Discuss why **single-purpose functions** are often preferred over
   multi-purpose functions.
-  **Split-apply-combine**, which lets you more easily parallelize. Make your code
   modular in a way that lets you split the steps and parallelize.
-  Think about "global data structures" vs "local data structures". It is not easy to
   separate them right.
