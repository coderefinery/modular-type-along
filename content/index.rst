Modular code development - Making reusing parts of your code easier
===================================================================

Type-along/demo where we discuss and experience aspects of (un)modular
code development. **We will focus on the "why", not on the "how"**.


Slides
------

We also have some slides:
https://github.com/coderefinery/modular-code-development.  But here we will try
to do this as collaborative type-along where instructors try to solve a problem
together and where learners guide the instructors through a collaborative
document.
