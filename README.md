# Modular code development - Making reusing parts of your code easier

- [Modular code development lesson DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16925149)

Type-along/demo where we discuss and experience aspects of (un)modular
code development.  It is an interactive demo with an intro, and then
instructors start with the basic code in a Jupyter notebook and build
up to something approaching a reusable command line script.  It's
usually done live, with the audience suggesting what comes next (not
following the given solution exactly).

## Adding more languages as examples

We welcome people to add more exercises as examples.  What to do:

* If you don't know of the lesson already, watch one of the videos
  and/or read it in detail.

* Find the example in the solution page, `content/solution.md`.
  Copy the `{group-tab}` for an existing language, copy it to below,
  and modify it for your new language.

* Add new files in `content/code/LANGUAGE/` and link them with the
  `literalinclude`.  Try to use the same base filename.

* Please don't submit pure AI generated code. These are examples to
  humans to understand certain concepts, not just to get something
  done.

* Send a pull request.  Don't worry if all the syntax is perfect or
  not, we can fix it and make it consistent, just focus on your
  language (or you could put just the language code in an issue and
  we'll do all the rest ourselves).
